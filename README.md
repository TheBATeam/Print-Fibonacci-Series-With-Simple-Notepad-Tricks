# Print-Fibonacci-Series-With-Simple-Notepad-Tricks
**Fibonacci Series** is a very important series in mathematics as well as a scientific point of view, and it has many uses in real life too!  We can print the elements of this Fibonacci Series in the cmd console with simple batch scripting.

# THE GOLDEN NUMBER!
The Fibonacci Series has a unique important constant associated with it, called **‘The Golden Number’**. You may have heard about it. But, here we are going to talk about writing a Fibonacci Program. You can read about the **Golden Number** at that link. I hope that you will like this simple but informative project, as this allowed me to learn a lot about **CMD** and **Windows**.

# LOGIC – SIMPLE NOTEPAD TRICKS
The logic of this series is easy to understand. That’s why whenever we are learning any programming language, we’ll always get a question that is to write a program to print the **Fibonacci series** on screen. We are going to do the same thing in Batch. 

CMD has some limitations, so we can only see the first 44 elements of the **Fibonacci Series**. This is only because when we want to print the 45th element of the series, the integer limit of the cmd variable exceeds) and thus it starts showing garbage values on the console screen. This may result in the malfunctioning of the program.
